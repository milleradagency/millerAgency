===============================

This theme is built on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) by Paul Irish and Divya Manian. The sole purpose of this theme is to save developers the time it takes to apply the HTML5 Boilerplate to WordPress. The "HTML5 Boilerplate" name is used with permission from Paul Irish.

The layout is based on Bruce Lawson's [Designing a Blog with HTML5](http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/)

Instead of using only DIVs for content layout, it uses new HTML5 tags, including [header](http://html5doctor.com/the-header-element/),
[footer](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_footer.asp),
[nav](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_nav.asp),
[article](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_article.asp),
and [section](http://html5doctor.com/the-section-element/).

It's a very bare layout, including only the base styles that come with the boilerplate and required WordPress styles, so layout is up to you. Alternatively, you could apply the methods used here to other themes.
